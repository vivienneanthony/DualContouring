Code
Octree progression into Uniform Dual Contouring. 


Ideas
1. At each progressive level save 8 points that's the average of the next levell. So the higher the depth the more detail.
2. Adding a obj output so it can help visualization 

This is a open project so anyone who has input or can help. Could eventually be used for projects.
